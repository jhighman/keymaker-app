# Application Architecture

## Overview

The KeyMaker application follows a modern React architecture with the following key characteristics:

- Component-based architecture
- Styled-components for styling
- Theme-based design system
- Vite as the build tool

## Directory Structure

```
keymaker-app/
├── components/         # React components
├── public/            # Static assets
├── docs/             # Documentation
├── App.jsx           # Root component
├── index.jsx         # Application entry point
├── theme.js          # Theme configuration
└── vite.config.js    # Vite configuration
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Component Structure
- The application uses a single-page component architecture
- Main functionality is encapsulated in the `KeyMaker` component
- Styling is handled through styled-components with a global theme

### 2. State Management
- React's built-in state management is used
- Theme state is managed through styled-components ThemeProvider

### 3. Styling Approach
- Styled-components for component-level styling
- Global styles defined in theme.js
- Responsive design principles

### 4. Build System
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Modern JavaScript features support

## Performance Considerations

- Component-based architecture for optimal rendering
- Theme-based styling for consistent performance
- Optimized build process with Vite
